# 🌊 Marea STEM – Key Points

- "How many times do you need a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation or need to look up a spec in a manual to validate an idea, and it ends up taking 5 hours ?" 
- The **downtime** from context switching (paper, calculator, **searching through folders of documents**) kills the speed of iteration in preliminary design. 
- **Marea STEM:** Natural language → Python code execution → Results in seconds. **Plus, it can search your own documents (PDFs, manuals, notes) and extract the exact answer without you having to open them.** Show 2-3 quick examples: a calculation + a question about a technical document.
- **Speed:** Immediate feedback.<br>2. **Traceability:** Shows you the code used.<br>3. **Multipurpose:** Math, physics, chemistry, data.<br>4. **Document memory:** Query your files as if you were talking to an expert who has read them all.
- **5. The Invitation** "This is for my own use, but I'm sharing it. **Imagine having an 'engineering assistant' that not only calculates but knows your entire technical library.** Does this approach work for you? Anyone want to use it, adapt it, or build something together?"
