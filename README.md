# 🌊 Marea STEM Pitch – Key Points

This document outlines the core structure and messaging for presenting **Marea STEM**, a personal chatbot designed to accelerate engineering workflows by combining conversational AI, Python computational libraries, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) over local documents.

| **Phase** | **Goal** | **Key Message** | **Time** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Hook** | Connect through a shared experience | "How many times do you need a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation or need to look up a spec in a manual to validate an idea, and it ends up taking 20 minutes?" | 20-30 s |
| **2. The Problem** | Define the friction you eliminate | The **downtime** from context switching (paper, calculator, **searching through folders of documents**) kills the speed of iteration in preliminary design. | 20 s |
| **3. The Solution (Demo)** | Show, don't tell. Visual impact. | **Marea STEM:** Natural language → Python code execution → Results in seconds. **Plus, it can search your own documents (PDFs, manuals, notes) and extract the exact answer without you having to open them.** Show 2-3 quick examples: a calculation + a question about a technical document. | 70 s |
| **4. The Advantages** | Highlight the differential value | 1. **Speed:** Immediate feedback.<br>2. **Traceability:** Shows you the code used.<br>3. **Multipurpose:** Math, physics, chemistry, data.<br>4. **Document memory:** Query your files as if you were talking to an expert who has read them all. | 30 s |
| **5. The Invitation** | Open the door for collaboration (synergy) | "This is for my own use, but I'm sharing it. **Imagine having an 'engineering assistant' that not only calculates but knows your entire technical library.** Does this approach work for you? Anyone want to use it, adapt it, or build something together?" | 20-30 s |
